# Seven-Segment-Clock
I designed the digital clock using PIC18F4520,  seven segments and the ULN 2083. I also used the  Oscillator in order to get an accurate and more  stable reading for the time. I have used 330K  resistors and 10K resistors in building the circuit this  is because seven segment require a certain specific  voltage in order to work properly.
